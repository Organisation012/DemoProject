The source told ABC News that the intelligence report was then briefed "multiple times" to the Defense Intelligence Agency, 

the Pentagon's Joint Staff and the White House.
Repeated briefings were held through December across the US government, including the National Security Council, culminating in a detailed 
outline of the threat in the President's Daily Brief in early January, according to ABC News, whose report cited four sources briefed on the matter.
The report, which CNN has not independently verified, raised concerns because of the disease's potential threat to US military forces in Asia, 
ABC News reported.
CNN is seeking a response from the White House National Security Council and the Pentagon. The Pentagon, the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence and White House National Security Council declined to comment to ABC News.
The Trump administration has faced criticism for not responding quickly enough to contain the novel coronavirus in the US, which now has the most 
confirmed cases globally. The intelligence report is the latest indication that the Trump administration had prior warning of the virus well before the 
first case was confirmed in the US in late January and further undercuts President Donald Trump's claims that the crisis was an unforeseen and unexpected 
problem.
